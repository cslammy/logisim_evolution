simulations for LogiSim
Please see blog post: https://audiodiwhy.blogspot.com/2021/08/digital-fun-damentals-inputs-outputs.html
I am zipping files for some of the sims.  This is to make sure to include any .circ file dependencies along with the final simulation file.
To use, unzip all files into a single folder.
