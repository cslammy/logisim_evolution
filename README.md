simulations for LogiSim....

Please see blog post: https://audiodiwhy.blogspot.com/2021/08/digital-fun-damentals-inputs-outputs.html

How to use the files:

I am zipping files for some of the simulations I have created.  

This to include any .circ file dependencies along with the final simulation file.

To use, unzip all files into a single folder and click on the .circ file that has the name of the IC or project.
