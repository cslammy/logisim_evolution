simulations for LogiSim....

Please see the last paragraphs of this blog post: https://audiodiwhy.blogspot.com/2021/08/digital-fun-damentals-inputs-outputs.html

How to use the files:

Some of the files are .zip format
 
This to include any .circ file dependencies along with the final simulation file.

So--if necessary, unzip all into a single folder and click on the .circ file that has the name of the simulated IC. That will load the sim and any dependencies needed.
